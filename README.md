## Usage
1. First you must enter your Open AI API token in __Preferences | Tools | ChatGPT Solution Generator__ and click __Apply__. To get your API token follow [this page](https://elephas.app/blog/how-to-create-openai-api-keys-cl5c4f21d281431po7k8fgyol0)

## Features
### Detecting the programming language
The plugin detects which programming language you are currently using (by your file extension) and asks Open AI to respond in this programming language. Thus, you don't need to write in the problem statement what programming language must be used:
+ **C++:**

+ **Kotlin:**

### Markdown parser
The plugin gets a response from Chat GPT in Markdown. [My own library](https://github.com/BagritsevichStepan/java-course/tree/main/MarkdownToHtml) parses the server response and inserts the response into the editor.

### Comments adding
–êfter the response is processed by the Markdown-Parser, the plugin adds comments to the response lines that are not part of the code blocks. The plugin supports the comment syntax of many programming languages.

+ **HTML:**
